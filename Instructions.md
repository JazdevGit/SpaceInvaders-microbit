Step 1
  download the python script

Step 2
  choose a micro:bit editor/compiler of your choice
  (I would recomend this one, since it is the one I created it on and it is the official editor: https://microbit.org/code/)

Step 3
  import the file or paste the code into the editor and play the game, feel free to edit or optimize any code
